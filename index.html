    <!---About me--->
    <section id="about">
      <h3 id="h3-about">About</h3>
      <p>I've always loved computers and and from the moment I built my first desktop computer at age 15, I knew that I wanted a career in technology in some capacity. I took classes in Information Technology and dabbled in coding, but I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to do with that knowledge.</p>
      <p> After learning more about CSS and designing themes for Tumblr, I decided that I'd like to do something that would allow me to pursue my interests in technology and design as well, so being a software developer was a great fit.</p>
